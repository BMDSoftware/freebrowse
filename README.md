# FreeBrowse - Browser-based Freeview Prototype

FreeBrowse is an experimental browser-based version of FreeSurfer's Freeview. This project serves as a proof-of-concept prototype, aiming to provide users with an alternative approach to interact with FreeSurfer data in a web browser. Please note that this prototype is currently in the early stages of development and is subject to frequent updates and changes in the upcoming weeks and months.

## Introduction

FreeSurfer is a powerful neuroimaging software suite widely used in neuroscience research to analyze and visualize brain imaging data. One of its essential components is Freeview, a tool that allows users to interactively view and explore neuroimaging data. FreeBrowse takes inspiration from Freeview and aims to provide a web-based alternative to access and visualize FreeSurfer data directly in your browser.
