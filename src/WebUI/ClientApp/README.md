# FreeBrowse Frontend

## First steps

We recommend to use Visual Studio Code as IDE and install the recommend workspace extensions.

The fastest way to launch and debug the frontend (along with a local backend deployment) is to press **F5** in Visual Studio code.

## Tailwind

[Cheatsheet](https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/)

We decided to use tailwind (instead of bootstrap) because its:
- more flexible and smaller
- recommend for webapps (while bootstrap has its advantages on websites)
- we have designers, so we need to build our own themes anyway
